0,Justin Palmer, 1 star ,"Non-existent service. We had to ask for menus, then look for a waiter to place our order and again to get drinks. I would understand if the place was busy, but it was only half full. The deep fried avocado was inedible. The sandwich was mediocre. No manager came to enquire if we were enjoying our food. Absolutely zero customer service here.",7 months ago

2,Nikolas Konstantinou, 5 stars ,"Great place for breakfast or to work from. I came here 3 times during my 2 week stay and it was a good experience every time. Health wise, the keto breakfast is perfect for me and my go to. Taste wise, the highlight for me is the Turkish Eggs. Great dish, bold but well balanced flavours, very unique. The chai latte is also really well done, one of the only places that doesn‚Äôt make their chai lattes sickly sweet but just a hint of sweetness. You pay JBR prices here, it‚Äôs not cheap, but it is nice.",9 months ago

4,Emily G, 5 stars ,"3 days in dubai 3 days at Common Grounds JBR. Its that good.

A friend reccomended it and its an absolute joy to be here. The vibe, the service, food and the beverages are all exceptional. So far i was here for  breadfast and lunch and the quality is consistent and very high. The qr menu is easy to navigate and the staff are super useful.

They have Keto and vegan options.

The only minus i had was that they dont have decaf but thats totaly fine at the end of the day",a year ago

9,Yevgen Sysoyev, 5 stars ,"Common Grounds in Dubai is a must-visit for anyone looking for an excellent coffee experience. The coffee is rich and flavorful, and the staff is knowledgeable and eager to help. The avocado toast is crunchy and flavorful, and the granola is the perfect accompaniment. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, and the service is excellent. The baristas are friendly and attentive, and they take the time to explain the different coffees available. This is a great spot to relax and enjoy a quality cup of coffee. Highly recommended!",a year ago

All the food was quite good but I‚Äôd say the flavors were a 4/5 for me.

We wanted to go to Eggspectations for breakfast first but it had a long waiting line and overall the place seemed very loud.
We found Common Grounds and the place had a lengthy breakfast menu and nice outdoor seating area so we decided to dine in.
I was happy with my benedict but would suggest to serve it with a light salad or something green on the side.",a year ago

The Coffee is the best I had in Dubai and - secret tip - if you ask you can get a coffee flatrate for 1h.

It has a super nice atmosphere that reminds me a lot of Bali.

And the staff is SO nice and friendly.

The staff working there was just the friendliest. Then really cared about our happiness and are really attentive.
And the food: INCREDIBLE. It is really high quality and very creative. Not just the same dishes you can get everywhere.

Would have loved to chose a salad without meat/eggs, but there wasn‚Äôt any on the menu. They refused. I asked for manager. The manager refused to replace bacon with any vegetable. Not because it wasn‚Äôt possible or anything, but because it is their ‚Äúcompany policy‚Äù. Replacing an item with ANY item from their choosing shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for an operation.

I told him I had read it, but I need your help. He refused and asked me to review the menu . Unfortunately, I fell in love with eating in the restaurant, but the bad service made me take a stand from the restaurant and not return to the restaurant again. It gave me a bad impression about it. I will not advise anyone who asks me about the restaurant to go to it because its service is very, very bad.",a year ago
